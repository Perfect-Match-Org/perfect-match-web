        <p>Dear Perfect Match users,</p>

        <p>
            We hope you all had a fantastic Valentine's day! As we approach mid-March, we wanted to send a quick
            follow-up email to let you all know about a fun surprise we have for you.
        </p>

        <p>
            We've partnered with the exciting, new, Cornell-founded dating app, Mutual, to bring you an even more
            personalized and enjoyable matchmaking experience. Mutual is a dating app where your friends matchmake you,
            allowing for more meaningful connections and a safer, more trustworthy dating experience.

            Mutual, you will automatically be able to continue (or start) the connections you made through Perfect
            Match, and we hope you all take advantage of this fantastic opportunity. Mutualâ€™s launch is planned for late
            March and spots are limited, so sign up to reserve your place now!

            We believe that our collaboration with Mutual will enhance the experience we set out to create. Thank you
