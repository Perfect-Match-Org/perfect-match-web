    <p>Hello hello!</p>
    <p>Hope you're enjoying the buzz around campus! Quick update from us at Perfect Match: we've cooked up a little
        something called ‚ÄúNudge Your Crush‚Äù ‚Äì and it's already turning heads!</p>
    <p>It's simple and sweet: if you're curious whether your crush might be a match, we can send them an
        <b>anonymous</b> nudge
        to take the survey. If they list you too ‚Äì bingo, it's a match!
    </p>
    <p>But we hit pause because we need a thumbs-up
        (or down) from you:</p>
    üëç [I'm In - Nudge Away!] ‚Äì Give us the green light, and we'll send a gentle anonymous hint to your crush. Who knows
    where a little nudge might lead?
    <br>
    üëé [I'll Skip] ‚Äì No, I would rather stay single this Valentine's.

    <p>No pressure, just a fun way to possibly connect. And remember, it's all anonymous ‚Äì so no worries about
        awkwardness.</p>
    </p>

    <p>Best Regards,<br>
        The Perfect Match Team</p>
    P.S. This is all in good fun, and you're in control. Your secret's safe, either way!
